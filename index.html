     <div class="grid-item">

       <p>With a total floor area of thirty-five square metres, which they never dared check,</p>
     
     </div>

     <div class="grid-item">

      <p>their flat consisted of a minute entrance hall, a cramped kitchen, half of which had been converted into a washroom,</p> 
    
     </div>

     <div class="grid-item">

      <p>a modest-sized bedroom, an all-purpose room - library,living-room or study, spare bedroom</p> 

     </div>
 
     <div class="grid-item">
      
      <p>- and an ill-defined nook, halfway between a broom-cupboard and a corridor, in which space had somehowbeen found for a matchbox fridge,</p>

     </div>

     <div class="grid-item">

      <p>an electric water-heater, an improvised wardrobe, a table, at which they ate, and a laundry-box which doubled up as a bench-seat.</p> 

    </div>
    
    <div class="grid-item">

      <p>On some days the lack of space became overwhelming.They would suffocate. But it was no use pushing back the boundaries of their two-roomed flatlet,</p> 

    </div>

    <div class="grid-item">

      <p>no use knocking down walls, calling up corridors, cupboards, openings,</p>

    </div>  

    <div class="grid-item">
    
      <p>no use imagining ideal wardrobes or taking over adjacent flats in their dreams,</p>

    </div>  

    <div class="grid-item">

      <P>they would always end up back in what was their lot, their only lot: thirty-five square metres.</P>
